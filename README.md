## Problem Statement
Modern Operating Systems are far too complex for beginners to analyze, and very few have any concrete documentation on their development. Similarly, many Operating Systems courses focus solely on interfacing with an existing Operating System (usually Linux).

There are very few up-to-date and centralized tutorials for actually building an Operating System from scratch. Additionally, many do not link any sources for their content, making it difficult to follow along. 

## Benefit
By developing our own operating system, we'll be able to have a beginner's perspective and highlight any problems we have that may be obvious to more experienced developers. We'll keep things simple and easy to understand, while not overwhelming.

All of the tutorials we've found so far have focused on the x86 (32-bit) architecture, while many modern operating systems have deprecated this old architecture in favor of the 64-bit x86_64 architecture. There are additional steps to enable this 64-bit mode which are not covered by existing tutorials.

Similarly, many tutorials and smaller kernels focus mainly on the ARM architecture due to the complexity of x86-based processors. However, the x86_64 chip remains the dominant architecture for all but embedded applications. Therefore, our tutorial will be more relevant for people who want to write a consumer-grade operating system.
